=======
# 🔐 Password-Generator-And-Strength-Checker
## (Django Python)
A Django-powered web application that evaluates password strength using industry-standard security metrics and generates high-entropy passwords to enhance security posture.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🔍 **Password Strength Analysis**  
✔️ Evaluates passwords based on multiple security parameters:  
   - **Length & Complexity**: Ensures passwords meet minimum length and contain a mix of characters.  
   - **Entropy Calculation**: Measures password randomness and resistance against brute-force attacks.  
   - **Dictionary & Common Patterns Check**: Detects weak passwords based on common patterns and dictionary words.  
   - **Breach Database Lookup**: (Optional) Checks passwords against public breach databases (e.g., Have I Been Pwned API).  
✔️ Provides **real-time feedback** to help users create stronger passwords with actionable recommendations.  

### 🔑 **Advanced Secure Password Generator**  
✔️ Generates **cryptographically secure** passwords with customizable settings:  
   - **User-Defined Length**: Choose password length for tailored security needs.  
   - **Character Set Configuration**: Enable or disable uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters.  
   - **Avoid Ambiguous Characters**: Optionally exclude visually similar characters (e.g., `0` & `O`, `1` & `l`).  
✔️ Generates passwords that comply with industry standards and security best practices.  

### 📜 **Industry Standards Compliance**  
✔️ Implements **NIST SP 800-63B password guidelines**, ensuring strong password policies.  
✔️ Optionally integrates with **Have I Been Pwned API** to check if passwords have been compromised in known breaches.  
✔️ Ensures compliance with security frameworks and regulations like **ISO 27001**, **GDPR**, and **OWASP Password Security Guidelines**.  

### 🖥️ **Intuitive & Responsive Web Interface**  
✔️ **User-Friendly UI** with a clean, modern, and responsive design.  
✔️ **Real-Time Strength Visualization**: Displays password strength dynamically as users type.  
✔️ **Copy & Save Features**: Easily copy generated passwords or download them securely.  
✔️ Supports **REST API Endpoints** for seamless integration with third-party applications.

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### ✅ **Entropy-Based Strength Analysis**  
- Measures **password randomness** using entropy calculations to evaluate its resistance to brute-force attacks.  
- Helps users understand how difficult their password is to crack based on statistical analysis.  

### 🚨 **Blacklist Protection & Breach Prevention**  
- Prevents the use of commonly used, weak, or breached passwords by checking against a **predefined blacklist**.  
- Optionally integrates with the **Have I Been Pwned (HIBP) API** to detect compromised passwords from known data breaches.  
- Users are warned if their chosen password has appeared in any known breach databases.  

### 🔏 **Secure Password Storage**  
- If authentication is implemented, passwords are **hashed & salted** using industry-standard cryptographic algorithms like **PBKDF2, bcrypt, or Argon2**.  
- Ensures that plaintext passwords are never stored, reducing the risk of credential leaks in case of a data breach.  

### 🛡 **Protection Against Common Attacks**  
- **Brute-Force Attack Mitigation**: High-entropy passwords make it computationally expensive for attackers to guess passwords.  
- **Dictionary Attack Prevention**: Detects and discourages weak passwords that match commonly used words and patterns.  
- **Rate-Limiting & CAPTCHA Support**: If integrated into an authentication system, prevents automated password-guessing attempts.  

### 🔐 **Encryption for Data Security**  
- Ensures that passwords and user-related sensitive data are transmitted securely using **TLS/SSL encryption**.  
- If integrated into a broader authentication system, applies **end-to-end encryption** techniques to secure sensitive user information.
